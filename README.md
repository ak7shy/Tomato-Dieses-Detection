# Introduction
Tomato diseases can significantly affect crop yield and quality. Early detection and identification of these diseases are crucial for effective management. This project employs a deep learning approach, using the VGG-16 architecture, to classify tomato leaf images into different disease categories.

# Data
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf/download?datasetVersionNumber=1 . After downloading, unzip the dataset and place it in the data directory within the project folder.
The dataset is organized into subdirectories, where each subdirectory corresponds to a different tomato disease category.

# Model Training
The model is trained using the VGG-16 architecture on the provided dataset.

# Results
Upon training and evaluation, the model's performance metrics, such as accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix, will be displayed in the console.
